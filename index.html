    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>My name is Pierce Lysinger, and I'm originally from Birmingham, Alabama! I'm thinking about double majoring in Finance and Marketing with a Kingfisher in Psychology. Some of my hobbies and interests include: playing soccer, running, anything outdoor recreation-related, reading, writing poetry, learning new things, playing guitar, New York Times puzzles, spending time with family and friends, and meeting new people! I'm involved in many organizations on campus including but not limited to a Freshman Leadership Program mentorship role, Campus Ministry leadership roles, New Student Orientation, and the Schlegel Center for Service and Justice. Some fun facts about me are that I'm the 8th cousin of Abraham Lincoln, I almost played college soccer, and I love the mountains.
